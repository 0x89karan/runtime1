# AgentOS / agentd — Project Memory

You are working on **AgentOS**: a Linux-based operating system where **agents are
the primitive, not applications**, designed to be **super light**. `agentd` is its
runtime. In the full system this process *is* the userspace (PID 1 / the boot
target); today it runs as an ordinary binary on a normal distro.

Read `docs/DESIGN.md` for the full thesis, architecture, and rationale.
Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the build plan — **this is the work queue.**
Read `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` before adding a subsystem, tool, or provider.

## Locked decisions — constitutional, do not drift

These were decided deliberately. Do not relitigate or quietly violate them:

1. **Cognition is remote.** The device is a thin agent host. The model is an API
   call behind `InferenceGateway`. There are **no local model weights** and no
   local inference engine. (Adding a *local backend* later is allowed only as a
   new `impl InferenceGateway`, never as a core assumption.)
2. **Single-tenant.** This is an OS for one individual. Agents are mutually
   trusting and run **in-process**. Do not add multi-user isolation, per-user
   auth, or tenancy boundaries. (Capability *scoping between agents* is in scope
   — see the roadmap — but that is about least-privilege, not distrust.)

## Current status

**Current version:** v0.97.0 (shipped 2026-07-24)
<!-- Updated on every release; test-enforced against agentd/Cargo.toml by
     agentd/tests/repo_consistency.rs — a stale line here fails cargo test. -->

**Latest shipped:** ux.13 (v0.97.0) — **control verbs (Cancel / SetCaps / SetBudget surface)**, the
final increment of the "trust after absence" cockpit reshape (ux.8′→ux.11→ux.12→ux.13). New
**`ControlCommand::{Cancel, SetCaps}`** + `AgentCancelled`/`CapabilitiesSet` events, reachable via
management HTTP (`POST /api/v1/agents/{id}/cancel` + `/caps`), FUSE control, and `agentctl
{cancel,set-budget,set-caps}` (TUI cancel-key deferred — CLI/HTTP/FUSE cover it). **Cancel** = "no new
world-affecting dispatch after cancel": a scheduler-side `cancel_requested` map (NOT checkpointed) +
a gate at the top of `enqueue_or_defer` that funnels a flagged agent when its in-flight future
returns (a running agent is flag-only — funneling it early would panic the pending-result arm);
cascade over `parent_map` (skips `"operator"`); `handle_agent_terminal` closes the run as
`"cancelled"`, emits `AgentCancelled` per node, purges deferred + pending_approvals. **SetCaps** =
revoke/narrow-only misconfig-repair (NOT a security response — cap.2b established runtime narrowing
isn't the injection defense): per-cap `capability_covered_by` (None=unrestricted accepts any narrow;
inert caps rejected), the scheduler computes `filtered_specs` and `set_capabilities` shrinks the
model's live tool list. **SetBudget** = the ux.11a semantics unchanged; ux.13 only adds the CLI/
DataSource surface + a ≥3s confirm client. **/review caught a cross-model-CONFIRMED P0** (the
`parked` predicate matched a running awaited child via `awaiting.contains_key` → panic; fixed to
`awaiting.values().any(|v| v.parent_id == node)` + 2 regression tests). /qa added an over-the-wire
route round-trip test. cancel/caps routes are ungated (join spawn/inject/budget; THREAT_MODEL note).
**Next:** the UX tail — ux.2b (idle/error signals), ux.3 (spawn-custom), ux.10 (TUI polish, incl. the
deferred cancel-key); then evidence-gated ux.6/ux.5/ux.7. cap.2b-ar-01 (P3) + cap.3 (`AbsPathPrefix`)
+ Phase 11 skills + Phase 9 eBPF still open.

## How to work here

- **Work the roadmap in order.** Each increment in `docs/ROADMAP.md` is a small,
  self-contained unit of work with explicit dependencies and acceptance criteria.
  Implement exactly one per branch; do not bundle several together. `main` stays
  shippable at every step. The roadmap's "How to use this with gstack" section
  describes the per-increment loop (`/plan-eng-review` or `/autoplan` → build →
  `/review` → `/qa` → `/ship`).
- **Preserve behavior across refactors.** Phase 1 begins by refactoring the loop
  into a steppable state machine; the single-agent path must keep working
  identically (the flight-recorder output for the demo should not regress).
- **Build, lint, and test before every commit — workspace-wide, from the repo
  root:** `cargo build --workspace && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --
  -D warnings && cargo test --workspace`. CI enforces exactly this across all
  five crates (ci.1) — per-crate commands from `agentd/` miss
  surfaces/sandbox/otel lints and go red in CI. (First workspace run rebuilds
  into the root `target/` — one-time cost.) Do not commit code that does not
  compile or that has clippy warnings.
- **Every version bump updates the "Current version" line in this file.** The
  line at the top of "Current status" is test-enforced against
  `agentd/Cargo.toml` (`agentd/tests/repo_consistency.rs`) — a release commit
  that bumps Cargo.toml without updating CLAUDE.md fails CI.
- **Linux-gated code requires a Linux clippy pass before pushing.** Any code
  under `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` (e.g. `surfaces/src/agents_fs.rs`) is
  never compiled on macOS, so local clippy is a false green. Run
  `make clippy-linux` from the repo root (requires Docker) before pushing a
  branch that touches Linux-gated code. This mirrors the CI step exactly.
- **aarch64-gated code requires an aarch64 clippy pass before pushing.** Any code
  under `#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]` or `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "x86_64"))]`
  (e.g. `sandbox/src/lib.rs` DenySpawn gate) has different behavior on aarch64.
  Run `make clippy-aarch64` from the repo root (requires Docker and `cross` installed
  via `cargo install cross --locked`) before pushing a branch that changes
  arch-conditional behavior. `Cross.toml` at the repo root pins the Docker image
  version so `ring`'s `build.rs` gets the correct `aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`.
- **Match the existing style.** Small modules, narrow traits, minimal
  dependencies. This is meant to be a *light* runtime — justify every new crate.
- Update `docs/ROADMAP.md` (check off the increment) and any affected doc in the
  same PR as the code.

## Invariants you must preserve

- **Record everything.** Every meaningful step an agent takes emits a structured
  flight-recorder event. New behavior gets new event kinds (see the taxonomy in
  `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`). Logging is best-effort and must never crash an agent.
- **Cognition is metered.** Token/$ usage is always accounted and bounded. New
  scheduling never removes the budget guard; it builds on it.
- **Secrets come from the environment, never config or code.** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  and friends are read from env. Never log a secret. Never write one to disk.
- **Tools go behind the `Tool` trait.** Anything an agent does to the world is a
  `Tool`. **MCP is the tool ABI** — prefer exposing capabilities as MCP servers;
  native tools exist only for zero-dependency convenience.
- **The loop never panics on bad input.** Provider/tool/parse failures become
  recorded errors and `Result`, not panics.

## gstack

Use `/browse` from gstack for all web browsing. **Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.**

Available skills: `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation`, `/design-shotgun`, `/design-html`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/canary`, `/benchmark`, `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/setup-browser-cookies`, `/setup-deploy`, `/setup-gbrain`, `/retro`, `/investigate`, `/document-release`, `/document-generate`, `/codex`, `/cso`, `/autoplan`, `/plan-devex-review`, `/devex-review`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/gstack-upgrade`, `/learn`.

## Commands

Runtime code lives in `agentd/`; run agents from there. The pre-commit quality
gate is workspace-wide and runs from the **repo root** (see "How to work here").

```bash
cd agentd

# Build
cargo build                      # debug
cargo build --release            # ~2 MB size-optimized binary

# Quality gate (run before committing) — from the REPO ROOT, not agentd/
(cd .. && cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings && cargo test --workspace)

# Run an agent (logs to stderr; final answer to stdout; events to flight.jsonl)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
cargo run -- agent.toml          # single agent
cargo run -- agents.toml         # multiple agents concurrently (p1.2+)
tail -f flight.jsonl             # watch it think
```

No OpenSSL dependency since p2.1 (`rustls-tls`). For a static musl build:
```bash
# requires `cross` (cargo install cross) and Docker
cross build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl --release
```

When in doubt about *what* to build next, the roadmap decides. When in doubt
about *how*, conventions decide. When in doubt about *why*, the design doc decides.
